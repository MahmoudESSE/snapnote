# Roadmap

Welcome! This is a semi-roadmap in which we base our development on the next versions yet to launch. Usually, (.x) versions are for fixing or implementing small features, and (x.) versions are when we contemplate implementing bigger features that can enhance the user experience exponentially.

### Version 0.1

*   Removed system outline issue (primarily occurring on Firefox). ✅
*   Fixed the hyperlink issue where, by adding a hyperlink, the color would stay the same. ❌
*   Fixed Export Menu and Copy To Clipboard state issues, where either refreshing or reopening the extension didn't recognize that there was content in the note until adding or removing a character. ✅
*   Added animations to the buttons and text outside the editor. ✅
